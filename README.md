# Car Report

---

**Not maintained:** Car Report has been a project I created and maintained in my free time. I realized that I don't enjoy maintaining it anymore and so I decided to archive it. The app is now unpublished on Google Play. Feel free to keep using the app as long as it works. I hope it has been useful to you. :-)

> Android app for saving and looking up costs (refuelings, ...) of your car.

Car Report is an android app, which lets you enter refuelings and other income and expenses of your
cars and displays nice reports. The following are currently included:

1. Fuel consumption
1. Fuel price
1. Mileage
1. Costs in general

You can add reminders based on mileage and time for car related recurring actions, e.g. general
inspection once a year.

It provides synchronization with Dropbox and Google Drive and has basic backup/restore and CSV
import/export functionality.
