# Privacy Policy

Juanro49 built Autu Mandu (fork of Jan KÃ¼hle Car Report app) as a open source app. This SERVICE is provided by Juanro49 at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform website visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation with this policy. The Personal Information that I collect are used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at Car Report, unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.


## Information Collection and Use

The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you if you choose to synchronize your data with one webdav server. The information that I request is retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.


## Security

I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
